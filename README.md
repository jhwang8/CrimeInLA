# CrimeInLA
Here I look into a public crime dataset on data.gov.

You can find the dataset here. I use the CSV version. 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

Here are some high level insights into the dataset before I go deeper.

A decent amount of the crimes (above 100000) is related to car theft.

Here are also the top areas in LA and the number of crime entries per area.
