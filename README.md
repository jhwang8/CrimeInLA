# CrimeInLA
Here I look into a public crime dataset on data.gov.

You can find the dataset here. I use the CSV version. 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

Here are some high level insights into the dataset before I go deeper.

A decent amount of the crimes (above 100000) is related to car theft.

Here are also the top areas in LA and the number of crime entries per area.

After grouping the dataset by month and ordering by month, we can see the number of crimes per month, assuming each data entry is an individual crime. There is a strange dropoff after 2024 that does not seem to be natural, but 2020 - 2024 can be assumed to be the legit trend.
